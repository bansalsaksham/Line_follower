# ü§ñ Line Follower Robot (Arduino + Adafruit Motor Shield)

This project is an **Arduino-based Line Follower Robot** that uses two IR sensors and the **Adafruit Motor Shield** to detect and follow a line on the ground. The robot adjusts its movement based on the sensor inputs to stay aligned with the line.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Dual **IR sensors** (left and right) for line detection  
- Motor control using **Adafruit Motor Shield**  
- Movement logic:
  - Move forward when no line is detected  
  - Stop when both sensors detect the line  
  - Turn left or right depending on which sensor detects the line

## üõ†Ô∏è Components Required
- Arduino UNO (or compatible board)  
- Adafruit Motor Shield (v1 or v2 depending on your setup)  
- 2 √ó DC Motors with wheels  
- 2 √ó IR sensors (left & right)  
- Power source (Battery pack)  
- Chassis and wires

## ‚ö° Circuit Connections
| Component            | Arduino/Motor Shield Pin |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Left IR Sensor OUT   | A4                        |
| Right IR Sensor OUT  | A5                        |
| Motor 1 (Left)       | M4                        |
| Motor 2 (Right)      | M3                        |
| IR Sensor VCC        | 5V                        |
| IR Sensor GND        | GND                       |

*The motors are connected through the Adafruit Motor Shield.*

## üìú Code Explanation
- `lefts = A4` and `rights = A5` are the IR sensors.  
- Motors are controlled using the **AFMotor library**:  
  - `motor1 = M4` (Left motor)  
  - `motor2 = M3` (Right motor)  
- Threshold for line detection is set at **400** (can be adjusted).  
- Movement logic:
  - **Both sensors detect line** ‚Üí Stop  
  - **Left detects line only** ‚Üí Turn left  
  - **Right detects line only** ‚Üí Turn right  
  - **Neither detects line** ‚Üí Move forward

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
1. Assemble the robot with two DC motors, two IR sensors, and the Motor Shield.  
2. Upload the code to your Arduino board.  
3. Place the robot on a track with a clear **black line on a white surface** (or inverted).  
4. Open the **Serial Monitor** (`9600 baud`) to see sensor values.  
5. Adjust the threshold (`400` in code) if needed depending on your IR sensors and track conditions.
